📝 Assignment: Mini RAG on Term Insurance Document

📂 Files Provided
- doc.txt → Term Insurance reference document (10 paragraphs)
- questions.txt → 5 simple queries

🎯 Objective
Build a mini Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using the given domain-specific document (doc.txt). 
Focus on three steps: chunking, retrieval, and re-ranking.

---

Tasks

Task 1 — Chunking
- Load doc.txt
- Apply two chunking strategies:
  1. Fixed window (40 words per chunk, 10-word overlap)
  2. Sentence-aware (combine 2–3 sentences per chunk)
- Compare number and size of chunks.

Task 2 — Retrieval
- Implement two retrievers: TF-IDF and BM25
- Run retrieval for each query in questions.txt
- For each query, return top-3 chunks from both retrievers.
- Compare retrievers.

Task 3 — Re-ranking
- For each query:
  1. Retrieve top-6 candidates using BM25
  2. Re-rank them using TF-IDF cosine similarity
  3. Return top-3 re-ranked chunks
- Compare baseline vs re-ranked results.
- Write 2–3 lines: Did re-ranking improve ordering?

Deliverables
1. results.txt → For each query: 
   - Top-3 chunks from TF-IDF
   - Top-3 chunks from BM25
   - Top-3 chunks after re-ranking


💡 Hints
- Normalize text before vectorization.
- Use scikit-learn (TF-IDF) and rank-bm25 (BM25).
- Keep results readable by printing chunk previews.
