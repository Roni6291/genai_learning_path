Introduction
Term insurance is the most straightforward type of life insurance. It provides coverage for a fixed duration (the “term”). If the policyholder passes away during this term, the nominee receives the death benefit. However, if the insured survives the policy period, there is usually no maturity benefit.

Purpose of Term Insurance
The main objective is to provide financial security to the family of the insured. It ensures that in case of an unfortunate event, dependents can continue their lives without financial hardship.

Affordability and Simplicity
Term plans are generally cheaper compared to whole life or endowment plans. They are designed to give high coverage for relatively low premiums. Since they do not involve savings or investments, they are easy to understand and transparent.

Choosing Coverage
Experts recommend that the coverage (sum assured) should be 10–15 times the annual income of the policyholder. This helps cover long-term expenses such as education, home loans, and daily living costs of dependents.

Policy Term Options
Most insurers allow you to select terms ranging from 10 years to even 40 years. Longer terms offer more security but may come with higher premiums. Choosing the right term depends on your financial responsibilities and future goals.

Add-ons and Riders
To enhance protection, insurers offer riders. These may include accidental death benefits, critical illness cover, premium waiver in case of disability, and income benefit riders. Riders help tailor the policy to individual needs.

Claim Settlement Ratio
Before purchasing a policy, it’s essential to check the claim settlement ratio of the insurer. This percentage shows how many claims the insurer pays out compared to claims received. A higher ratio builds confidence that claims will be honored promptly.

Tax Benefits
Premiums paid for term insurance are eligible for tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Additionally, the death benefit received by the nominee is usually tax-free under Section 10(10D).

Online vs Offline Plans
Many insurers now offer online plans that are cheaper due to lower administrative costs. Online plans also provide flexibility, transparency, and instant premium calculators. However, some people prefer offline plans for the personal guidance of an insurance agent.

Limitations of Term Insurance
Term plans do not build wealth. If the policyholder survives the term, there is no return of premium unless a “return of premium” option is chosen, which increases the cost. It is therefore important to buy term insurance primarily for protection, not investment.
